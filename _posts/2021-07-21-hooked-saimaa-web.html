        <h1>Hooked Saimaa Website Design</h1>
        <p>Hooked Saimaa is a company that provides fishing trips for all kinds of people.
            The brand is very inclusive and wishes to provide an outlet for people who want
            to experience Saimaa in all of its glory.

            I made a website design using Figma as a part of UX course and also as a client work.
            I tried to enchance the best aspects of the brand design
        </p>
